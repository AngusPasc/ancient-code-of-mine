Natali Imbruglia : Wishin' I was there

Verse:
F    			          Eb/add9
Take your hand and place it in my pocket

Flick your eyes back in their sockets
Bb  					           F
Put those thoughts away sometimes they're much too loud
 			                 Eb/add9				  
I'll take a breath and cradle your sweet head
		            Bb
Should've stayed at home in bed
	               F
Put that face away I'm melting for you


Pre-Chorus:
  Bb
I know
      Dm
I get cold
F
Cause I can't leave things well alone

Understand I'm accident prone
Bb
Me 
         Dm
I'll get free
Eb     	                Bb
Every night the moon is mine


Chorus:
  	             F
But when the morning comes
	      Eb/add9
Don't say you love me
	      Bb
Don't say you need me
                     F
I really don't think that's fair

Boy I'm not so dumb
             Eb/add9
But when you leave me 
        Bb     	              F
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there


Verse:
  F	                       Eb
I dreamt about another girl in bed with you

You just laughed and smiled
Bb
Denied the proof
	          F
We're fine till I think of the problem

I wish it made sense
          	        Eb
Like a joke that no one gets
	              Bb
It's a life without regret
		         F
I want to feel that way, forever and ever


Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus


Bb                    F
Wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there
Bb	              F
Wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there with you
Bb	              F
Wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there
Bb		      F

	      Eb/add9
Don't say you love me
  	      Bb
Don't say you need me
                     F
I really don't think that's fair

Boy I'm not so dumb
	      Eb/add9

I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there

Wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there
Bb		      F
Wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there with you
