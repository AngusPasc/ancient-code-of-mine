<h1>Four corners project"</h1>
<p>Since November 2008, we have been implementing our “Four corners” program, which has been the cornerstone of our activities.</p>
<p>“Four corners” represents the coming together of four groups:
	<ul class="Kompas">
		<li>People with experience with mental illness</li>
		<li>Their friends and family</li>
		<li>The public</li>
		<li>Mental health professionals</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The concept was introduced in Slovakia by P. Nawka, MD within the project of “Reintegration of the psycho-socially disadvantaged into the society” in 1997.</p>
<p>The objective of the Four corners Program is to initiate and promote communication and cooperation of all stakeholders in creation and provision of mental health community care services in the regions of Trnava and Bratislava.</p>
<p>We have set the following objectives within this program:
	<ul class="Kompas">
		<li>Create services, which will reflect the needs of people with mental illness and the needs of their families, friends and other to whom they turn for support</li>
		<li>Develop effective forms of destigmatization based on accurate understanding of public sentiments</li>
		<li>Develop effective methods of engaging professionals in the process of transformation of mental health care, considering their capacities and competencies</li>
		<li>Use the opportunities to provide information to the public concerning mental health, mental illnesses and health care for people with mental illness to overcome the taboos associated with such topics and the stigma attached to people with mental illness</li>
		<li>Point out new trends in the area of mental health care (for example, new forms of community and social services)</li>
		<li>Promote motivation and flow of awareness of all stakeholders, so that they may show initiative and active support in improving the situation of people with mental illness and their families</li>
	</ul>
