     [G]Let me take you down 'cause I'm going [Dm7]to Strawberry Fields.
     [E7-5]Nothing is real.
     And [C]nothing to [D]get [E]hung about.
     [Am7]Stawberry Fields [D]fore[G]ver.

[D]Living is easy with [D7]eyes close[B7]d,
[Em]Misunderstanding all you [C]see.
[Am7]It's getting [D7]hard to be some[G]one but it all works [Em]out,
[Am7]It doesn't [D7]matter much to [C]me.[G]   [C]

     Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
     Nothing is real.
     And nothing to get hung about.
     Stawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree,
I mean it must be high or low.
That is, you know you can't tune in but it's all right,
That is, I think it's not too bad.

     Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
     Nothing is real.
     And nothing to get hung about.
     Stawberry Fields forever.

Always know sometimes think it's me,
But you know I know and it's a dream.
I think I know of thee, ah, yes but it's all wrong,
That is, I think I disagree.

     Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
     Nothing is real.
     And nothing to get hung about.
     Stawberry Fields forever.
