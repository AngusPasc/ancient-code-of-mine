     STAND BY ME arranged by John Lennon  Written By Ben E. King
      CHORDS: A, F#m, D, E, A

      When the night has come and the land is dark
      and the moon is the only light to see

      No I won't be afraid No I..I won't be afraid
      Just as long as you stand by me stand by me

      Darling Darling Stand By Me
      Oh Now Now Stand by me
           Stand by me
           Stand by me



      If the Sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
      and the mountains should crumble to the sea

      I won't cry I won't cry  No I..I won't shed a tear
      Just as long as you stand by me stand by me

      Darling Darling Stand By Me
      Oh Stand by me
           Stand by me
           Stand by me



      Whenever your in trouble won't you stand by me
      Oh now now stand by me oh stand by me stand by me

      Darling Darling Stand By Me
      Oh Stand by me
          Stand by me
          Stand by me
