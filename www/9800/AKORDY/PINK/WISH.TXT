[C]So, so you think you can [D]tell,
heaven from [Ami]hell? 
Blue skies from [G]pain?

Can you tell a green [D]field, 
from a cold steel [C]rail?
A smile from a [Ami]veil?
Do you think you can [G]tell?  

Did they get you to [C]trade,
your heroes for [D]ghosts? 
Hot ashes for [Ami]trees?  
Hot air for a [G]cool breeze?  

Cold comfort for [D]change
And did you [C]exchange,
a walk-on part in the [Ami]war, 
for a lead role in a [G]cage...

Ref:
                               
[C]How I wish, how I wish you were [D]here
We're just [Ami]two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, [G]year after year
[D]Running over the same old ground,
[C]what have we found - the same old [Ami]fears? Wish you were [G]here
