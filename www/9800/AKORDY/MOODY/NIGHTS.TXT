NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN
Moody Blues
 
Em                D       Em                     D
  Nights in white satin       never reaching the end
C              G          F                    Em
  Letters I've written        never meaning to send
Em           D            Em                    D
  Beauty I'd always missed    with these eyes before
C               G         F                  Em
  Just what the truth is      I can't say anymore
 
 
CHORUS
        A               C
Cause I love you, yes I love you
           Em           D      Em       D
Ohhh how I love you
 
 
Gazing at people, some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be, you'll be in the end
 
 
CHORUS
