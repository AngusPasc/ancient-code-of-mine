I was walking around just a face in the crowd,
          Em                      Em
tryin´ to keep my self out of the rain.
D     Cadd9                   D 
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown,
         Em                    Em
wondered if I might end up the same.
D       Cadd9             D    Em     
There´s man out on the corner, singing old songs 
      C
About change
                    D                    G     G
Everybody god their cross to bear, these days

She cam looking for some shelter 
       Em    
With a suitcase full of dreams.
D    Cadd9                D
To a motel room on a buolevard,
        Em        
I guess she´s trying to be James Dean.
D     Cadd9            D                          C 
She´s seen all the disciples and all the wanna be´s.
C               D                   Em
No one wants to be themselves these days
              C                  D            G
Still there´s nothing to hold on to but these days

These days the stars seem out of reach
      C                    D               G
These days there ain´t a ladder on these streets
      C                D             G                  C
These days are fast, love don´t last in these graceless age
C                       D            G         
There ain´t nobody left but us these days.

Jimmy shoes busted both his legs, 
Em                 Em
Trying to learn to fly
D      Cadd9           D            Em         
>From a second story window, he just jumped and closed his

eyes.
D   Cadd9            D                Em                C
His mama said he was crazy - he said: mama "I´ve got to try"
C                   D             Em
Don´t you know that all my heroes died
C                      D             G
And I guess I´d rather die than fade away
