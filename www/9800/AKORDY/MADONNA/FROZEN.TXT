This song is pretty easy to play. There could be a

Just listen to the song to get the timing of the

Intro: Fm

Fm
You only see wat your eyes want to see
How can I feel what you want it to be
      C#         D#
You're frozen,      when your heart's not open

Your so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken, when your heart's not open

Chorus:
Fm        D#         C#           G#
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, you....are...the key...

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
if I'd lose you, my heart will be broken

Love is a bird she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
Your frozen, when your heart's not open

 - CHORUS -

 - INTERLUDE -

You only see wat your eyes want to see
How can I feel what you want it to be
You're frozen, when your heart's not open

Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, you....hold the key...

Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, you....hold...the key...

If I could melt your heart...
