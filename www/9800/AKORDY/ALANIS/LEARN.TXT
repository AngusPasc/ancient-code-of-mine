Ab      Gb                                        Ab     Gb
  I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone
Ab      Gb                                        Ab     Gb
  I recommend walking around naked in your living room
Db            Eb
  Swallow it down what a jagged little pill
Db            Eb
  It feels so good swimming in your stomach
Db               Eb
  Wait until the dust settles

Chorus:
Ab                   Fm
  You live you learn
                     Eb
  You love you learn
                 Db
  You cry you learn

  You lose you learn
Ab                    Fm
  You bleed you learn
                   Eb    Db
  You scream you learn

I recommend biting off more than you can chew I certainly do
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time feel free
Throw it down the caution blocks you from the wind
Hold it up to the rays
You wait and see when the smoke clears

Repeat Chorus

B   Db   Ab  (8 times)

Db           Eb
  Wear it out the way a three year old would do
Db           Eb
  Melt it down you're gonna have to eventually anyway
Db           Eb
  The fire trucks are coming up around the bend

Repeat Chorus

  You grieve you learn
  You choke you learn
  You laugh you learn
  You choose you learn
  You pray you learn
  You ask you learn
  You live you learn
