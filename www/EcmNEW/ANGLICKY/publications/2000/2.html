</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this issue we would like to inform our customers about a new multicomponent analyzer solution we launch on the European market on the eve of the third
Millenium.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As known, modern analyzers for continuous monitoring are based on the principle of optical irradiance absorbtion at certain specific wavelengths. The reason of absorbtion is resonance excitation of certain atom or molecule bounds. Atoms and simple molecules electron bounds show absorbtion in UV spectrum. More massive dipols of complicated molecules show remarkable absorbtion in infrared spectrum. UV spectrum is unfortunately almost entirely overlapped by absorbtion of everywhere present oxygen and thus allows sensitive and accurate monitoring of only very limited range of gaseous compounds (SO2, NO, NO2, BTX class hydrocarbons...).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IR spectrum can be used for gas analysis in substantially broader range and is therefore used by most of modern analyzers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Classic method for such analyses is nondispersion analysis (international abreviation NDIR). With this method only certain, relatively narrow band is selected using optical filters, in which an analyte shows significant
absorbtion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to relatively wide scale of optical band filters transmittance the instrument detects not only absorbtion caused by gas monitored, but also absorbtion caused by various background gases, influence of which should be compensated. Multicomponent NDIR analyzers are equipped with carousel with different optical filters having bands transmittance characteristic for a respective analyte. Therefore we can using these analyzers provide for detection of only such compounds absorbtion spectra of which are significantly different (in order no bands transmittance overlapping occurs) and absorbtion of which has sufficient "distance" from background gases
absorbtion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the reason why using NDIR instruments it is virtually impossible to carry out so often required multicomponent SO2, NOx, CO, CxHy, HCl, HF and NH3 analysis (main problem is interference with water vapours) in emission applications and monitoring of more complicated organic compounds in technological applications.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most advantageous method for multicomponent detection of various gaseous compounds in IR spectrum is analysis based on Fourier transformation. This method is not a new one, however instruments being on the market so far show considerable problems with accuracy and reliability due to temperature changes, vibrations and calibration requirements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ECM nowadays launches a new analyzer differing from the other instruments of this kind on the market in automatic compensation of interferences and more elaborated interpretation of monitored parameters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the following we will briefly describe working principle of the instrument. The analyzer monitors absorbtion spectrum in the range of wavelengths 500 to 4000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Absorbtion cell transmittance can be characterized as the ratio p = I / Io, where Io is an input energy and I characterizes energy at the output from the cell. It is obvious, that 0 % represents full opacity and 100 % full transmittance.</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><i>Figure 1 : Transmittance spectrum of HCN</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Around the main absorbtion line we can see HCN absorbtion characteristics relating to transition of vibration quantum number to higher levels. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Envelope shape of side peaks is described by Boltzman distribution, where its shape is temperature dependent. Absorbance can be described as A =
f(p).C.L.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This formula represents linear expression of absorbance dependency on C.L, product of concentration and optical path, which is usually expressed in units
ppm.m.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now few words about instrument construction itself. Irradiance of the stable ceramic IR source passes after focussing through an aperature and gets onto a collimating mirror creating a cylinder shaped beam. This passes through a beamsplitter (being the most expensive part of the instrument).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One part of the light is reflected onto a fixed mirror and the other part passes onto a moving mirror fixed on a grafite piston and placed in precisely grounded glass cylinder. Piston movement is secured by a linear motor. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And now becomes heart of the matter. Optical waves reflected by the moving mirror interfere on the fixed mirror with the signal deflected by 90°. In the case of matching phase waves are added up, whereas in the case of phase drift about 180° they are subtracted from each other to make a zero output signal. In such a way created modulated signal passes to an absorbtion cuvette being a bottom extension of optical path depicted on the Figure 2. Modulation frequence falls into an acoustic band. Since it is a broad band IR source, spectrum of modular frequencies is also broad. As will be shown later, mathematical apparatus of Fourier transformation reliably determines absorbtion spectra. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we will approach this stage, we will clarify another feature of this instrument, which makes it so different from usual IR interferometers. In parallel with a broad band IR source depicted on the Figure 2 the instrument comprises also a helium-neon laser.</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><i>Figure 2 : Schematic of FTIR Modulator</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its monochromatic light with the wavelength of 0.6328 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#109;</FONT>
 passes through the entirely same optical path as described above. However, on the modulator output it gets onto a special miniatur detector. This is equipped with four quadrants. Transition of these monochromatic waves through a zero level (approximately 6000 times per second) measures moving mirror movement velocity (around 2 cm/s) and represents timing of broad band signal sampling. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four detector quadrants detect in equal short intervals deviations from ideally rectangular configuration of optical assembly (due to vibration transferred from the environment and not always perfect parallelism of the moving mirror).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the help of four electromagnets, on which the mirror is fixed, these deviations are immediately corrected.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The instrument is thus perfectly resistant towards mechanical, temperature and other interferences, which so remarkably limit usage of FTIR interferometers in industrial environment. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 3 shows a typical interferogram in the area of central "burst” with Fourier lines sums (meaning of which cannot be interpreted without mathematical analysis) folded on both sides.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please note, that units on the x-axis represent sampling intervals divided by multiple transitions of laser signal.</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><i>Figure 5 : Phenol absorbtion spectra at different concentrations</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The left absorbtion group represents CO<sub>2</sub>, the medium low
H<sub>2</sub>O level and the right one is caused by various organic compounds. Individual models have clearly defined spectra. Absorbance amplitude changes with different concentrations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 5 shows as an example various phenol absorbtion spectra at different wavelengths. However, some spectra overlapp. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 6 shows the result of NO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> spectra overlapping.</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><img src="../../../slovensko/publikacie/images/prekrytie.gif" width="480" height="360"></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><i>Figure 6 : NO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> spectra overlapping</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The instrument uses a mathematical apparatus based on reference spectra library, calculation of the system of equations and application of the method of smallest squares with indication of maximum determination fault of all of more than 200 gaseous compounds monitored. Calculation takes around 200 ms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Noise represents only 10<SUP>-5</SUP> of the signal level - the instrument provides for 2 magnitudes "clearer" output than the other known methods!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The instrument is supplied in 2 basic configurations. In the first case it is "open path" measurement, in the second case monitoring on extractive principle.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of "open path" measurement the beam passes directly through the environment monitored. These instruments are designed for emission or working environment monitoring. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Open path" instruments have 3 versions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>transmitter and receiver mounted in a common head, where emitted IR beam is returned to the head by means of a reflector</LI><LI>2nd version is similar to the previous one, but transmitter and receiver are mounted in separate heads placed next to each other</LI><LI>transmitter and receiver are mounted in separate heads opposite to each other. Connection is made by a cable or microwave transfer.</LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Distance between transmitter and receiver is usually several hundreds of metres. From the metrological point of view the 3rd configuration variant is the most advantageous one. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In extractive configuration sample passes through the optical cell, in which assembly of gold coated mirrors provides via multiple reflections for optical absorbtion line in the range of 10 - 100 m, according to sensitivity we want to obtain.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entire assembly is heated to 185°C in order no condensation of acid components in sample occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Important feature of the instrument is that interferometer and absorbtion system are separated from each other. Interferometer can therefore work with several absorbtion systems in switching mode. Typical application is monitoring of pollutants coming from a certain production technology requiring measurement along four sides of quadrangle perimeter (fence-line monitoring). In this case one interferometer assembly in the corner is sufficient for two optical paths monitoring. The most common extractive system applications are monitoring of emissions from incinerators, paint shops, various chemical technologies, as well as emissions from production of semiconductors, efficiency monitoring of integrators, oxidation stages and gas purity monitoring (e.g. for semiconductors production). The instrument is supplied also in mobile version with aim to monitor more technologies in the respective plant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, allow us to stress main differencies between our analyzer and the other comparable instruments on the market:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Dynamic correction of optical assembly setting makes the instrument insensitive to vibrations and temperature changes.</LI><LI>Output is in the whole range of measured values linear.</LI><LI>Dynamic correction efficiently eliminates interferences in the entire measuring range even with significant changes of monitored gas composition.</LI><LI>The instrument requires no calibration.</LI><LI>The instrument shows no spectrum shifting fault.</LI><LI>The instrument requires no periodical zero point adjustment.</LI><LI>Range change, addition or omitting of measured parameters require no manipulation with the instrument. These procedures can be performed remotely from the production facility with usage of modem connection.</LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The instrument is entirely attendance free.</P>
