Big Mistake	
Natalie Imbruglia
from the album Left of the Middle

Here's a quick rundown...

"Dropped D" tuning (DADGBe, low to high)


Intro
=====
A G D  x4

Verse
=====
A            G           D 
 There's no sign on the gate
 And there's mud on your face
 Don't ya think it's time we reinvestigate the situation
 Put some fruit on your plate

Prechorus
=========
E                  A
 You've forgotten how it started
E 
 Close your eyes
   F#
 Think of all the bubbles of love we made

Chorus
======
A            G             D
 And you're down on your knees
           F
 It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
A         G         D
 And you lie by my feet
F        
 What a big mistake, I see you fallin'

Verse
=====
 A       G         D
 Got a buzz in my head
 And my flowers are dead
 Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation
 Don't believe what you said

Repeat Prechorus
Repeat Chorus

Verse
=====
A          G           D
 I could sting like a bee
 Careful how you treat me 
 Baby I don't think I'll accept your sorry invitation
 Close the door as you leave

Repeat Prechorus
Repeat Chorus

Alt. Chorus
===========
A         G        D 
 And you cry over me
F  
 I can't wait, I feel you stallin'
A         G        D
 And you try to reach me
F
 What a big mistake, I hear you callin'

Repeat Chorus

Anyone needing any tips, tricks, help with this tab or life in
general, I'm at
