"Knockin' On Heaven's Door", words by Bob Dylan, performed by U2.

I was looking through the archive and I noticed that the song is not in
there.  I think U2's version is incredible, and should be in here.
I tabbed the song from a live version they did circa 1984 in Chicago, in
case any of you have ever heard the version.  It's a very simple song
with an awesome little solo.

There are two guitars for the song: and acoustic and an electric with a
delay pedal (set to about .4 seconds).

The acoustic plays the same chords througout the song, and it opens the
song for the first verse:

VERSE (Just keep playing same intro chords for the entire song)
G             D               Am
Bobby take this badge off of me
G         D           C
I can't wear it anymore
G            D             Am
It gets so dark I cannot see
G                D                     C
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

REFRAIN
G             D                     Am
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
(repeat refrain once)

VERSE 2: bring in the electric playing same exact chords

Bobby take these guns to the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
A long black cloud is coming down
It looks like we're knockin' on heaven's door

REFRAIN

After refrain, play this little solo, with heavy delay

SOLO:

e----------------------------------------------0------
b--3--5--3-5-3-5--3-5-3-1-0-0-0-1-0--------------0----
g-----------------------------------2-0---------------
d---------------------------------------0-0h2---------

e-7-5-7-8-7-5-5-3-3-3-2-2-3-0--5-3-7-10------10---10---10---10---10\-
b---------------------------------------8--8----8----8----8----8---\-

The rest of the song just repeats the same chords.
Enjoy!
