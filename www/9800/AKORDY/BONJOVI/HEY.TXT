BON JOVI
Hey God

Music and lyrics by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora



D5
Hey God, I´m just a little man I got a wife and family
C5
But I almost lost the house, yeah I bought into the dream
G5
We´re barely holdin´ on, when I´m in way to deep
C5 D5 C5
We´re two paychcecks away from living out on the streets

D5 
She´s a workin´ single mom, like a saint she don´t complain
C5
She never says a word, but she thinks that she´s to blame
G5
Her son just got convicted, he blew some punk away
Bb 
She did her best to raise him, but the world got int he way

D5 /C
Hey god tell me what the hell is going on
/B
It seems like all the good shits gone
/G /C 
It keeps on getting harder hanging on, but hey hey hey 
D5 /C
Hey god, there´s nights you know I want to scream
/B
These days you´re eve harder to believe
/G /Bb G5
I know how busy you must be, but hey god....
D5
Do you ever think about me?


Born into the ghetto 1991, just a happy child
Playing beneath the summer sun
A vacant lots´ his playground, but 12´s got a gun
The odds are bet against him, junior don´t make 21

D5 /C /C /B /B Bb 
Hey god....do you ever think about me
Bb D5 D5 /C /B /G F D5 /C 

D5
I´d get down on my knees, 
I´m doing to try this thing your way
/B Bb
Seen a dying man too proud to beg spit(sit)on his own grave
D5 
Was he too gone to save?
/C
Did you even know his name?
/B Bb
Are you the one to blame, I got something to say

D5 /C
Hey god....about me
/B
Do you ever think about me?
/Bb D5 /C D 
Well hey god, hey god do you think about me?
