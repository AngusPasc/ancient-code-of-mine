Intro: Am   F     C        G  (4 times)

Am	F	C	G
Go on and close the curtains
'cause all we need is candlelight
You and me and the bottle of wine
and hold you tonight

Am	F	C	G
Well, we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
so take this wine and drink with me
let's delay our misery...

Chorus:

Am      F
Save tonight
C         G
Fight the break of dawn
Am      F
Come tomorrow
C         G
Tomorrow I'll be gone

Am	F	C	G
There's a log on the fire 
and it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire..
to take me away

Am	F	C	G
It ain't easy to say goodbye 
darling please don't start to cry
'cause girl you know I've got to go
and Lord I wish it wasn't so

[chorus]

Solo

Play this next verse a bit muted...

Am	F	C	G
Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
but girl you know I've got to go, oh
and Lord I wish it wasn't so

[chorus]
