Sixpence None The Richer : Kiss Me

Capo 1st fret) D Dmaj7 D7 Dmaj7 (x2)
D Dmaj7
Kiss me out of the bearded barley
D7 Dmaj7
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
D Dmaj7
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
D7 G
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
Em A D D7
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Em A D D7 
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Em A
Lift your open hand
D D/C# D/B D/A
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
G A add sus4 D Dmaj7 D7 Dmaj7
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
*Interlude* D Dmaj7 D7 Dmaj7 (x2) Em A D D7 (x2)

Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
So kiss me, so kiss me, so kiss me...
