I'm sitting here in a boring room,
     Fm                        Cm
It's just another rainy sunday afternoon.
    Fm               Cm
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
    Bbm7                Cm
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
    Bbm7            Cm           Fm      Cm Fm
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.


I'm driving around in my car,
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.


  G#            D#
I wonder how, I wonder why
Fm                              Cm
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    C#             D#                   G#          D#7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
    G#              D#
I'm turning my head up and down,
Fm                                  Cm
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    C#             D7dim                      D#      D#7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.

Dam     dadoudi....


I'm sitting here, I miss the power.
I'd like to go out, taking a shower,
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself to bed,
Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.


C           Fm
Isolation - Is not good for me,
D#          G#                       C
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.
    Fm                   Cm
I'm steppin? around in a desert of joy
Fm                     Cm
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
    Bbm7               Cm               Fm      Cm Fm
And everything will happen - and I will wonder.


I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
I'm turning my head up and down,
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree. And I 
wonder..., I wonder...
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    C#             D#       C#             D#    
And all that I can see, And all that I can see, 
    C#             D#     D#7           G#
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.

There's already an archive for it from Enrico Angella
<gelpa@flashnet.it> ( I've put it at the end of my transcription),
but what he wrote doesn't sound to me like the song.
Here's the easiest way to play it. The rignt tune is with capo up to
the first fret.
