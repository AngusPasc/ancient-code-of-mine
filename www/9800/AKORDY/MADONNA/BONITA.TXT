   Dm              C                  Dm
   Last night I dreamt of San Pedro,
Bb/D Dm        F                 C
   just like I'd never gone I knew the song.
      Dm                  C                 Dm
   A young girl with eyes like the desert.
Bb/D Dm                   F                  C  A/C#
   It    all  seems like yesterday, not far away.

   CHORUS:

   Dm              Am       Am7 Gm                F
   Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free.
    C                   Gm                     C Dm
   This is where I long to be, La isla bonita.
   (Dm)              Am         Am7 Gm                 F
   And when the samba played, the sun would set so high,
            C                           Gm
                                   C  Dm
   ring through my ears and sting my eyes. Your spanish lullaby.

   Dm       C                  Dm
   I fell in love with San Pedro, 
Bb/D     Dm              F                     C
   warm wind carried on the sea. He called to me:
 Dm    C       Dm
   "Te diso te amo."
Bb/D  Dm                 F                             C       A/C#
   I   prayed that the days would last, they went so fast.

   CHORUS

   Gm        Eb                  F                Csus2
   I want to be where the sun warms the sky.
                  Gm        Eb                   F
   When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by.
   Gm          Eb           F              Csus2
   Beautiful faces, no cares in this world.
                Gm             Eb            F    A/D     Dm
   Where a girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl.

   REPEAT CHORUS
