# Ancient Code of Mine

The oldest source code I've managed to keep until now. Pure Turbo Pascal, pure fun.

## [LOD - 25 November 1997](LOD/LOD.PAS)

I was 14 years old. It features shared global mutable state and probably all
antipatterns you have ever heard about. But for me it's the best code I've ever
written.

## [F&D - 4 January 1998](F&D/F&D.PAS)

Find & Destroy. Stunning itro, dynamic graphics, but there's nothing more
unfortunately.

Enter size of the grid, enter number of mines and play the classical Windows game.

## [CERVIKY - 17 June 1998](CERVIKY/CERVIKY.PAS)

Multiplayer worms game where the goal is not to crash. The last one wins. Worms
can also fire bricks or what is that.
