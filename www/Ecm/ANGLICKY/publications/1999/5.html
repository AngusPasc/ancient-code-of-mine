<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Individual TSI divisions devote to development of instrument technique designed for the most challenging tasks of basic research, as well as wide range of industrial applications.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the field of demanding applications TSI takes a leading position in particulates concentration and movement monitoring. Application of laser technologies allows exact determination of number of particulates in air and their size separation even in the range of nanometers. Main applications of this techniques are in ecological research, combustion engines development support, farmaceutical and chemical industry and military area.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ecological applications are aimed at determination of number of particulates of certain size in ambient air. Particulates size determines, how deeply they penetrate into lungs by breathing. New research results show that particularly contact of particulates with lungs causes a large number of civilization problems (natural particulates are captured by body filters, whereas virtually all particulates penetrating into lungs are of antropogenous origin).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TSI instruments can not only exactly determine number and separation of particulates, but can also as the only ones in the world analyze their chemical composition in real time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Industrial research applications are most of all aimed at exact determination of flow speed and direction in real time with nanosecond particulates resolution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Typical examples are: flow research in spark-ignition engines (e.g. Mercedes), in aircracft turbines or of sprays for various applications. In military industry TSI laser instruments are used to immediately distinguish products of bacteriological weapons according to shape and size of particulates.</P>
<p ALIGN="center"><font FACE="Times New Roman"><img border="0" src="../../../slovensko/publikacie/images/tsikruh1.jpg" width="500" height="522"></font></p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One example of the above mentioned techniques in usual industrial applications is accurate monitoring of dimensions and movement speed of stretched and rolled materials, such as wires, opto-fibres, pipes, plates and metallurgy products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TSI laser instruments find their implementation also in such demanding applications as are monitoring of accurate turbine vane dimensions at full load for the purpose of their exact final polishing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Less demanding, but much more sold assortment of TSI instruments are portable instruments designed for air flow velocity in rooms and piping monitoring. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their primary aim is to set up air-conditioning enquipment. Apart from flow velocity they determine and store also data of temperature, pressure, humidity and contents of pollutants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experts will be certainly interested in instruments funnel-shaped sampling nozzle of which is put on the output (usually ceiling) of air-conditioning air supply. Instrument presents and stores information on air flow and supplementary parameters (temperature, humidity).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interesting applications of TSI technology are also instruments designed for observation of correct gas mask application. Principle of instrument operation lais in accurate determination of number of particulates in ambient air and in internal space of mask. When mask is placed correctly the difference should be up to three magnitudes.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special application of TSI flow sensors is pressurized protection of rooms. These can be for example hospital infection departments or ultrapure rooms of farmaceutical and semi-conductor production plants. With difference to usual differential pressure sensors requiring remarkable pressure differencies and consequently energy consumption in order to keep pressure difference measurable, TSI instrument works on the principle of air flow from one into the other room monitoring.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thermal-conductive flowmeter is placed into the small aperture in the wall separating respective rooms and monitoring if air flows in right direction. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This system allows in magnitude more accurate pressure difference maintenance than conventional differential pressure gauges. Keeping safe operation at smaller pressure differences in comparison with surrounding rooms saves 50 % of energy!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much more effective energy saving is obtained with suction equipment control in chemical processes. Valve in suction piping control optimizes pressure conditions, whether fume hood doors are open or not. TSI delivers individual components as well as entire solutions of air distribution control.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some final words on several times mentioned flow sensor solution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With difference to unstable and faulty flow velocity sensors working on heated wire principle, TSI produces accurate thermal-conductivity mass flowmeters with the range up to 0 - 300 l/min.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from its own final products TSI sells also flowmeters in OEM version according to customer’s requirements, most of all to various air-conditioning equipment producers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have found information on TSI products to be interesting, we will be happy to provide you with more detailed information. Many information can be found directly on very comprehensive and detailed internet page

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you certainly know, company Procal is the main ECM partner in the field of in-situ gas analyses. In this issue we would like to make you acquainted with up-to-date information relating to new solutions of this well known company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all we would like to inform you about Procal 5000 instrument. It is a continuous in-situ analyzer using absorbtion spectroscopy. The instrument analyses a complete UV spectrum. Fast processor and elaborated equipment allows with help of extensive absorbtion spectra library for accurate determination of monitored components concentration and effective elimination of interfering influences.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Typical applications are for example determination of 1 - 2 ppm H2S on the background of 300 and more ppm SO2 in emissions of recovery boilers in pulp and papery factories. At the same time it is possible to monitor also other sulphur compounds, such as DMS or DMDS. In comparison with extractive methods complicated and sensitive sample intake and conditioning system is eliminated. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Procal 5000 alows automatic calibration of zero and reference levels by calibration gases from pressurized bottles. In such a way (with difference to other in-situ methods) Procal instruments allow for automatic verification of monitored parameters. Apart from sulphur components Procal 5000 allows to monitor also NO, NO2, Cl2, NH3 and many other compounds showing absorbtion in UV spectrum.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most often used Procal instrument is well-known in-situ Pulsi 200LR analyzer. Pulsi 200 analyzers are usually supplied in configuration designed for 6 measuring ranges.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><i>Typical specification is the following :</i></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supplementary oxygen analyzer has the range of 0 - 21 % O2. The analyzer is installed directly into the sampling point on a stack. Flue gas flows directly through the photometric measuring transducer of the analyzer. Advantage of this instrument in comparison with similar devices is mainly placement of photometric part into the filtration tube.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This construction has several decisive advantages in comparison with solutions where optical parts of an in-situ analyzer are placed directly in process. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Sample is filtered, therefore flue gas does not soil sensitive optical components.</LI><LI>Tube is periodically filled with instrument air or calibration gas, so inaccurate measurement is eliminated. "Across the stack" analyzers, which are mostly present on the market, do not have this possibility. This is the reason, why particularly in case of SO2 and NOx monitoring drastic measurement failures quite often occur. </LI><LI>If flue gas temperature falls below 110°C, photometer space fills automatically with instrument air. In such a way damage of optical parts due to influence of condensing acids is eliminated. </LI><LI>In the case of permanent instrument operation at low flue gas temperatures with condensing water or even water droplets in flue gas the tube can be heated; in the case of operation at high temperatures on the contrary cooled down.</LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">System control and evaluation unit represents PC computer. One PC can control up to 4 sensor heads. Since the instrument monitors water contents, data are presented on dry as well as wet basis expressed in mg/Nm3 units.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are happy, that an important operator of a large refinery complex in the Near East has decided to equip 7 emission sources with Pulsi 200LR analyzers monitoring NOx, CO2 and H2O. Analyzers are delivered in accordance with US EPA 40 CFR, parts 70 and 75, with optional certificate Cenelec Eexd II B T6 (this was condition of participation in the project). The customer aimed in selection process at reliability and maintenance requirements on one hand and high accuracy and repeatability requirements fulfilment on the other. For the benefit of Pulsi 200 decided also the fact that it does not require sample intake and conditioning system enhancing maintenance requirements. Certainly, Pulsi 200LR is designed for long-term attendance-free operation. Automatic diagnostic programmes inform operator about rare failure of a certain component before the system breaks down.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New Procal application is monitoring of malein acid anhydride together with CO, CO2 and buthane components. This analysis is used for production of chemicals that are necessary for synthesis of organic compounds. The instrument is used to be calibrated for the range of 0 - 2 %. Within routine funcionality controls it is possible to use a pressurized bottle with usual NO in nitrogen. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reliability and accuracy of Procal instruments in process applications has been reliably proved in many petrochemical plants all over the Europe.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps it is pointless to mention that ML imission analyzers of the company Monitor Labs began to write history of high-quality continuous ambient air pollution monitoring. 9000 series represents current top of technical solution of analyzers and ECM is unseparable part of this process.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to American market stagnation and, on the contrary, increase of the interest in monitoring systems in Europe and some Asian countries instruments production has been moved from Denver to Scotland. Production is registered under the name Monitor Europe, Ltd. Types and construction of the analyzers have not been changed, however they are of EU origin and therefore they are cleared through customs more advantageously than before and transport costs are lower. Therefore, from the customer point of view all good news:
favorable price, close support, better communication. </P>
