</B><P>Instrument methods of gas analysis can be divided into 3 categories:</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>in-situ</LI>
<LI>straight extractive</LI>
<LI>dilution extractive</LI></UL>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gas analyzers are mostly photometric instruments working on the principle of energy absorption of a particular part of spectrum by a measured component. For lower pollutants levels different optical methods, such as fluorescence or chemiluminiscence may be used. The analytical part of the instrument is located inside or outside measured gas. In the first case it is in-situ, in the second case extractive measurement. Extractive systems can be straight, when sample gas being monitored (in most of the cases after filtration and moisture removal) enters the analyzer directly, or dilution, when sample gas is diluted with instrument air before entering the analyzer. The most frequently monitored components are SO2, NOx, CO, CO2, HF, HCl, NH3 and hydrocarbons. In-situ analyzers are offered in the form of multicomponent instruments for determination of all pollutants.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Optical beam is in instruments emitted directly through the flue gas stream being monitored. Instruments in it their usual configuration provide typically acceptable results when monitoring CO and CO2. The main problem is zero drift, the largest "enemy" of all photometric instruments. Indirect calibration methods do not allow for satisfactory solution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, two exceptions exist (<I>Marek - for Poland only one</I>): Instruments based on tunable laser diode, such as instruments delivered by our partner organization Norsk Elektro Optikk, and multicomponent instruments with folded beam, produced by the company Procal. For the completeness’ sake we have to mention also UV-VIS spectral analytical methods, providing in many cases good results. However, we consider their initial cost and cost of ownership to be exaggeratedly high, whereas other methods offer better results for lower price. Instruments based on tunable laser diode allow for direct absorption monitoring in a single absorption line of the gas being monitored.</P>

</p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Light spectrum emitted by a special laser diode is very narrow - approximately 0,5 nm. Diode frequency change of some nanometers allows to find out teoretical Gauss shape of the absorption line. Determined deformations are caused by interfering compounds. Instruments allow for accurate measurement and are used mainly for monitoring of HF, NH3 and HCl, i.e. pollutants where other methods fail. There are also different categories with respect to these instruments, but their description exceeds scope of this article. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case of folded beam methods the photometric sensor is situated in a tube being inserted into the gas monitored. Sample passes via appropriate filters and flows freely through the tube. Decisive advantage of this method is possibility of automatic tube filling with calibration gas or instrument air. This procedure allows for correct zero and span calibration and all interfering influence elimination. Therefore, for SO2, CO and NO monitoring a single IR photometer can be used, as opposite to classic methods where optical beam passes through the duct directly and due to problems with interference IR as well as UV photometric sensors have to be used. Initial cost and cost of ownership of these instruments are considerable (remarkable item is costly UV lamp requiring often replacement). </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is most commonly used measurement in our country. The largest problem of extractive systems is condensation of water, acids and other components being present in the measured sample. With unsuitable system construction
accidentally contamination and corrosion of sensitive instrument parts can occur, not speaking about measurement inaccuracy caused by lost of in water soluble components. The result is system contamination, corrosion and inaccuracy of the measurement.</P>
<p ALIGN="center"><font SIZE="3">

<img border="0" src="../../../slovensko/produkty/images/4900.jpg" width="158" height="68">
</font></p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore necessary to tailor sample intake and conditioning system to every single application in such a way that no problems are detected. However, with straight extractive system one can never eliminate (in case of some failure) condensation of aggressive acids in the analytical part of the system. Construction of the analyzer itself has therefore to fulfil requirements for reliable and accurate measurement of determined components with minimum influence of interferences on one hand and resistivity against contamination and corrosion on the other. The most frequently used construction principle of analyzers is dual beam infrared method. The optical beam is split into two beams. The first beam passes through the gold plated cuvette filled with reference gas, while the second beam passes through the cuvette with flowing sample. A special detector compares energy of both beams. Energy ratio of both beams is interpreted as concentration of the measured component. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Weaknesses of this method are: </P>

<UL>
<LI><b>Extreme sensitivity to mechanical contamination</b></LI><LI><b>Sensitivity to interferences</b></LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As soon as gas mixture contains components showing optical absorption in the same optical band in which the analyzer determines a particular pollutant, interferences occur that cannot be corrected (in flue gas it is usually influence of water and CO2). Therefore ECM prefers analyzers based on gas-correlation principle.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gas-correlation measuring instruments use a single measuring cell and a simple solid state detector. IR beam is emitted periodically via two glass cuvettes mounted on a rotating wheel. The first cuvette is filled with nitrogen, the second one with measured gas of high concentration. When the beam passes trough the cuvette filled with nitrogen, detector sensed energy is influenced by absorption of the measured gas in the sample, interfering elements and mechanical impurities. When the beam passes through the cuvette filled with 100 % concentration of the gas to be measured, detector sensed energy is influenced by total absorption of this gas, interfering components and mechanical impurities. Resulting signal is therefore directly proportional to the determined component. The best instrument of this category we consider to be the Xentra 4900 analyzer.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the most robust method of gaseous pollutants monitoring. Gas sample is mixed with dry clean instrument air in the ratio of 1/15 up to 1/300. Diluted sample is analyzed in high sensitivity analyzers. These are in fact the same instruments as implemented in ambient air monitoring systems.</P>
<p ALIGN="center"><font SIZE="3"><img border="0" src="../../../slovensko/produkty/images/nox.jpg" width="158" height="84"></font></p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Low flue gas flow allows for effective automatic filtration on one hand, usage of sensitive and selective
imision analyzers for high measurement accuracy on the other. Calibration gas is transported directly into the sample probe, whereas it is diluted in the same ratio as the sample, thus correcting for inaccuracies of all system parts. Due to low dewpoint it is not necessary to use heated sample line. (Sample condensation and system corrosion cannot occur.) Critical part of the system is the mixing chamber where instrument air with sample are mixed together. Gas flow is set by means of critical orifice (flow velocity through a small aperture is limited by sound speed). Exact value of dilution ratio is not important, because the system is calibrated using gas transported into the probe. What is really important, is temperature stabilization of the mixing chamber, since temperature variations can cause aperture size change and hence change of dilution ratio during operation. </P>

In order to evaluate emissions according to legislative requirements it is necessary to monitor also auxiliary parameters, such as oxygen concentration, temperature, pressure and flow of flue gas, and often also concentration of dust particles. In the following we will mention the most important solution methods of instrument equipment for their determination. </P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For determination of oxygen concentration in emissions electrochemical, zirconia or paramagnetic transducers may be used. In-situ or dilution analyzers of gaseous pollutants concentration are used to be supplemented with self-contained zirconia oxygen analyzer. The best instrument we consider to be Xendos 2700, semiextractive principle and construction details of which provide for higher accuracy, response, reliability and life time expectancy than other comparable instruments on the market. In case of extractive systems oxygen transducer is a part of a multicomponent gaseous pollutants analyzer. In practice electrochemical or paramagnetic transducers are used. ECM prefers paramagnetic measurement, which is accurate, stable and with difference to electrochemical methods does not require regular costly measuring cells replacement. Paramagnetic sensor is a part of the multicomponent analyzer Xentra 4900.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If flow cannot be calculated from fuel consumption or generated energy, it is determined on the basis of flue gas flow velocity. As a matter of fact, the following methods are used:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pitot tube, anubar, ultrasonic measurement and discontinuities determination. Advantage of the Pitot tube is simple construction and the consequent low price. Disadvantage is point character of the measurement. This is eliminated by usage of anubaric sensor. However, methods on the principle of pressure difference are sensitive to clogging. This problem cannot be sometimes fully solved even with back pneumatic purge. Ultrasonic instruments do not suffer from the above mentioned disadvantages. Due to restriction of ultrasonic signal propagation in flue gas caused mainly by temperature, dust load and CO2 content, these instruments are substantially more complicated than in case of common industrial applications where they are designed for liquids or cool gases flow determination. Smart way of flow velocity determination is to monitor solid particles discontinuities in short time interval. The instrument consists of two connected dust electrodynamic sensors. Distance between the sensors is 50 mm. Time needed for characteristic dust composition change "flow" from the first sensor to the second sensor is proportional to flue gas flow velocity. </P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instruments for continuous dust in flue gas concentration determination can work on optical, beta-absorption or electrodynamic principle. The most commonly used instruments are opacimeters. These instruments monitor optical beam energy absorption by particles present in flue gas.</P>
<p ALIGN="center"><font SIZE="2"><img src="../../../slovensko/publikacie/images/tuhe.gif" width="230" height="208">
</font></p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Disadvantage of this method is sensitivity to mechanical adjustment of optical units, remarkable influence of particles shape, colour and reflection, smoke darkness, as well as difficulties caused by the fact that only negligible part of the optical source energy passes through the flue gas. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simpler and cheaper solution offer instruments working on the principle of optical beam energy reflection from the particles. These instruments are less dependent on particle characteristics, however do not sample the whole cross-section of the monitored duct.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the most accurate optical measurement one can consider solution of the company PCME. The instruments are similar to classic opacimeters. However, subject of the analysis is not the beam absorption, but noise spectrum of the detector, caused by particles "floating" through the optical beam. This method is substantially more accurate and independent of size and surface character of particles than it is the case of classic optical instruments. Very important thing is that they show no drift, which is the main problem with classic instruments. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The newest method of dust monitoring is electrodynamic principle. Instruments determine noise spectrum of potential on the electrode placed in flue gas. It is the potential induced by charges of particles flying around the electrode. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For measurements after wet scrubbers, where flue gas temperature is low and particles are mixed with water droplets, the most suitable way is to use beta-absorption instruments. Their function is rather complicated and we will discuss it in some of next Bulletin issues. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have introduced basic instrument methods used in emission monitoring systems. We know, that in order to be transparent we have not mentioned instrument equipment for determination of total sulphur, ammonia, hydrocarbons and some other components. We will discuss these instruments in some of next issues of our Bulletin. Particular attention will be paid also to data systems creating inseparable part of emission monitoring.</P>
