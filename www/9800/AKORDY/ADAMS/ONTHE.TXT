Basically, "On A Day Like Today" uses 5 Chords, (Am, C, G, D, Em)
These Chords are quite simple, Usually Bryan prefer "quite simple chord." I
think that "Simple Chord" is more impressive in omparison with "Difficult
Chord".

"C" is 1st chord of "Back To You"
"Am" is 2nd chord of "Back To You"
"G" is 4th chord of "Back To You" or 1st chord "House Arrest"
"Em" is 2nd chord of "I'm Ready"
"D" is 1st chord of "Summer Of '69" or 1 st chord of "Cuts Like A Knife".

Thanks,
