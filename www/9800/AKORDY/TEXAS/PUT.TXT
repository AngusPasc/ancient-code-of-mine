                            *Autumn Breeze Mix*                 

                         [Transcribed by TNT SHWE]


Notes: 

          Okay, I've heard the album version and it seems to differ a
little from this one, but this version from the single release was the
only version avaliable to me!  I assume the Autumn Breeze Mix is in the
same key as that on the album and also fea tures the same lyrics, but when
I find out for sure, I'll get back to you!
