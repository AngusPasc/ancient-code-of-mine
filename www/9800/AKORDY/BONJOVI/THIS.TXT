BON JOVI
This ain´t a love song

Music&lyrics: Jon Bon Jovi & Richie Sambora


Verzia 1:

E B/D#
I should have seen it coming when the roses died
Bm/D A/C#
I should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
Am/C E 
I should have listened when you said good night
B
You really meand good bye
E B/D#
Baby, ain´t it funny, how you never ever learn to fall
Bm/D A
You´re really on your knees, when you think you´re standing 
tall
Am E B
But only fools are know-it-alls and I played that fool for you


A
I cried and I cried
C#m B
There were nights that I died for you baby
A C#m B
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

Ref:
E B
If the love that I got for you is gone
C#m A
If the river I cried ain´t that long
E B Aadd9
Then I´m wrong, yeah I´m wrong, this ain´t a love song


Verzia 2: (zhodná s verziou 1)

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the rest of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime but,
We were just legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade,
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn´t fade
You and I were the renegades, 
some things never change

It made me so mad ´cause I wanted it bad for us baby
Now it´s so sad that whatever we had, ain´t worth saving

If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain´t that long
A
Then I´m wrong, yes I´m wrong, this ain´t a love song

If the pain that I´m feeling so strong
Is the reason that I´m holding on
A
Then I´m wrong, yeah I´m wrong this ain´t a love song
D A - Bm G - D A - G 

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy

If the love...
If the pain...
If the pain...
A
Yes, I´m wrong, yeah I´m wrong, this ain´t a love song (3x)
Aadd9
this ain´t a love song
