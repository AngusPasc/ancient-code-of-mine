</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Program equipment ECM CEM takes in full extent above mentioned criteria into account. Its basis, D2000 software, is compatible with the software used in the systems "Transit gas pipeline monitoring and control", "Nováky power plant information system" or installation in nuclear power plant Jaslovské
Bohunice.</font></P>

<UL>
</B><LI><font size="3">signal source - analyzer / sensor / transducer</font></LI>
<LI><font size="3">control and datalogging system at measuring site - PC / PLC / datalogger</font></LI>
<LI><font size="3">computer server</font></LI>
<LI><font size="3">operator consoles - local / network / distant operator</font></LI></UL>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Server communicates with analyzers directly, through dataloggers, PC or PLC, and provides also for connection to local computer networks. Authorized user gains access to immediate data as well as to archived data (raw, calculated or processed data according to different criteria) either directly on a server console or via distant console installed in a local network, or through modem transfer provided by commuting link. On the operator console the same presentation
program equipment as on the server is being installed. In such a way each user in the network has the same comfort as the server operator. The same pays for distant authorized users. The only difference is, that data are archived only on the server. It should be pointed out, that all data do not have to be processed only according to one key. Data coming from emission monitoring, water monitoring or imission monitoring station can be processed in different and unique way. Each group according to specific requirements and respective legislation.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">The most important we consider to be a subsystem for emission monitoring data processing. The reason is relatively large number of data processed in real time. There can be various files of mathematical interchannel calculations as well as treatment of numerous status signals. Extraordinarily strict is also the requirement for minimum 95 % system reliability. This reliability comprises failures of every kind - instruments malfunction as well as data processing failure. From the point of view of reliability the most advantageous is attitude, where dataloggers are used between analyzers and the server. There are of course also other, less reliable possibilities. ECM deliveries cover not only projects containing new components. Often existing monitoring components in a plant are used. Model solution can be schematically presented in the following way:</font></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><img border="0" src="../images/11999.gif" width="400" height="416"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font><font size="3">Server can be equipped with different communication drivers allowing for collection of measuring and calibration data, alarm messages from different information sources, and thus providing possibility of creation of the systems integrating data of different origin and character into a unified system. Data coming from emission monitoring on one hand and imission and water monitoring on the other are processed using one system, however according to separate criteria.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In case of simple systems we prefer direct PC (it does not even need to have character of server) connection with an analyzer. It is advantageous, if the analyzer allows for direct communication via serial output. This eliminates need for double A-D and D-A conversion. PC is responsible for calculations and datalogging. However, in the case of PC drop-out measured data will be lost.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In case the analyzer is not equipped with a serial output, conversion cards have to be installed into the PC. Monitoring of larger enterprises is much more difficult, however. Individual PC or dataloggers have to be used for data preprocessing. The task of PC or DL in monitoring systems is to sense immediate values, calculate minute and 30 minute averages, to archive them, evaluate validity of sensed immediate values (taking into account analyzers functionality or validity level of measured parameters) and validity of mean half-hour averages. Access to data is secured by system of passwords.</font> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">DL is a data microprocessor system, suggested for data reception, control, logging and archived data print-out in the form of tables and graphs. It is a "black box" of the system, in which once sensed, calculated and archived values cannot be changed by no means.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">From the hardware point of view DL is designed as a processor board with memory cooperating with modular architecture of interface cards, which can be configured as
follows :</font></P>
<ul>
  <li><font size="3">analogue input card with 8 voltage inputs</font></li>
  <LI><font size="3">analogue input card with 8 current inputs</font></LI><LI><font size="3">card with 8 digital inputs</font></LI><LI><font size="3">card with 8 digital outputs</font></LI><LI><font size="3">card with 4 analogue outputs</font></LI>
</ul>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">DL firmware provides for the following operations in monitoring systems:</font></P>

<UL>
<LI><font size="3">continuous monitoring of analogue signals from analyzers and their conversion from analogue to digital form by 14-bit AD converter</font></LI><LI><font size="3">evaluation of immediate values validity taking into account mask</font></LI><LI><font size="3">digital inputs signaling system status</font></LI><LI><font size="3">calculation of 1 minute averages from valid immediate values</font></LI><LI><font size="3">evaluation of 1 minute averages validity</font></LI><LI><font size="3">calculation of 30 minute averages from valid 1 minute averages</font></LI><LI><font size="3">evaluation of 30 minute averages validity</font></LI><LI><font size="3">30 minute averages archiving</font></LI><LI><font size="3">print out of immediate and archived values on terminals</font></LI><LI><font size="3">system calibration control and creation of calibration print outs</font></LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">DL monitors immediate values of analyzer analogue outputs being connected to DL analogue inputs. At the same time DL monitors its own digital inputs by means of which correct operation of the respective analyzer is being monitored, and thus determined validity or non-validity of measured data.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Digital inputs monitor also information on the status of monitored technology. In case of fulfilment of immediate value validity it considers such a value as a basis for basic 1 minute interval calculation. 1 minute averages are calculated as an arithmetic average of all immediate values within the respective minute. 1 minute average is considered to be valid for 30 minute average calculation, if all of its representative immediate values are valid.</font> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">DL further calculates mean half-hour values as arithmetic averages from 1 minute averages of individual monitored parameters. Mean half-hour average is considered to be valid, if more than 67 % of 1 minute averages is valid. In DL a valid half-hour average is marked with the sign "<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#62;</FONT>
", while a non-valid half-hour average is marked with the sign "<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#60;</FONT>
". DL allows for retrospective viewing of 1 minute averages and 30 minute averages of archived parameters. It means, that even after interruption of communication between PC and DL the
program equipment retrospectively reads all missing data after renewing of the connection. Archiving capacity of 1 minute averages is limited to 2 hours. In case of power failure data and configuration memory is backed-up in DL for more than 2 months.</font> </P>
