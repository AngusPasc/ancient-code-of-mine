<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this issue of our Bulletin we would like to inform you on a modular system of PULSI analyzers. These are multicomponent analyzers suitable for emission as well as process applications. PULSI analyzers work on the principle of fotometry in IR, UV or visible part of spectrum. The following components can be monitored using PULSI analyzers:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lowest possible measuring range is about 10 ppm, maximum meassuring range is usually up to 100 %. The most often installed analyzer of PULSI series is an in-situ instrument with model indication PULSI 200LR. In the following we will devote in more detail to this instrument used mainly in emission monitoring systems. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PULSI 200LR analyzer makes use of in situ (installed in stack) measuring cell, thus eliminating need for sample extraction from a duct and related costly, maintenance requiring sampling systems. Apart from that, the instrument analyses unmodified, real representative sample gas. PULSI 200LR series analyzers are designed for analysis of up to 6 emission components present in gaseous phase. PULSI 200LR system consists of 3 standard units: <B>optical head unit, analyzer control unit and automatic zero unit</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One control unit is able to support up to 4 optical head units of any type of PULSI analyzers. PULSI 200LR system offers in comparison with usual in-situ instruments working on cross-stack measurement principle (direct beam propagation in flue gas without filtration) mainly the following advantages:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. With difference to cross-stack systems, where virtually no zero calibration possibility exists (mechanical placement of cuvettes into the beam path and retrospective calculation of zero point, when accuracy required by legislation is not reached, cannot be considered as a real calibration), in case of PULSI 200LR system real calibration using calibration gases in closed photometer space takes place. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. For monitoring of usual group of pollutants (SO2, CO, NOx) instruments require usually 2 measuring units (IR for CO, CO2, H2O or NO, and UV for SO2 or NO). Due to innovative IR technology PULSI 200LR allows to determine all components in IR part of spectrum. Consequently costs of investment and ownership are much more lower (using 1 measuring unit instead of two, no need for often costly UV sources replacement).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The instrument works on two-beam infrared principle, where signals at two wavelengths (each specific for one measured gas) are transmitted through the measuring cell of the optical unit installed in stack.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Measured signal is partially absorbed by measured gaseous components, while reference signal remains relatively untouched. There are 8 wavelengths in total, whereas reference wavelengths are in some cases common. This allows for simultaneous measurement of up to 6 gaseous components. Selected IR wavelengths used for analysis are obtained by means of interference filters and gas filled cuvettes (GFC) installed on a rotating wheel situated inside the optical head unit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PULSI 200LR uses for measurement technique of reflected beam. Measuring cell consists of the process lens placed in robust stainless steel tube and retroreflector situated on the remote end of tube, protected from solid particulates by sintered stainless steel filter. Collimated IR beam passes through the measuring cell onto the retroreflector returning the beam to the detector through the set of lenses. In folded beam technique the optical head unit has effective length of the sampling path 1 meter, which ensures high instrument sensitivity and allows measurement of low minimum detectable gas level. Cross sensitivity (interferences) is in PULSI 200LR eliminated using gas-filter correlation (GFC) that provides higher primary sensitivity and reduces cross sensitivity, as well as using another measuring wavelength specific for the component causing cross sensitivity. This signal is used in equations for calculation of measured gas concentration, thus eliminating cross sensitivity effect. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Optimum PULSI 200LR system operation is enhanced also by automatic zero unit. It activates system zero control on the basis of command from the control unit by filling sampling tube with zero gas, which is often dry instrument air. Apart from automatic zeroing function the unit has also safety function. In case of analyzer power failure or low flue gas temperature the automatic zero unit pressurizes measuring cell with instrument air. Automatic zero unit includes also powering of in-stack heater, which is used if the analyzer is applied in environment with the temperature lower than flue gas
dewpoint. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">System control and evaluation unit represents an industrial version of personal computer. Up to four measuring units can be connected to this unit. Apart from PULSI 200LR there are also other model versions allowing measurement of difficult to monitor flue gas components, technological gases and even liquids. One should mention the way of liquid components measurement - a special crystal is with one end emerged into measured liquid medium, while its other end is placed in the measuring beam path in the photometer. Crystal transforming optical environment thus allows measurements that cannot be otherwise performed. Using this method also corrosive condensates presence in the measuring cell is eliminated.</P>
