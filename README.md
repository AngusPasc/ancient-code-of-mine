# Ancient Code of Mine

The oldest source code I've managed to keep until now. Pure Turbo Pascal, pure fun.

## [LOD - 25 November 1997](LOD/LOD.PAS)

I was 14 years old. It features shared global mutable state and probably all
antipatterns you have ever heard about. But for me it's the best code I've ever
written.

## [F&D - 4 January 1998](F&D/F&D.PAS)

Find & Destroy. Stunning itro, dynamic graphics, but there's nothing more
unfortunately.

## [MINY - 21 May 1998](MINY/MINY.PAS)

Enter size of the grid, enter number of mines and play the classical Windows game.
