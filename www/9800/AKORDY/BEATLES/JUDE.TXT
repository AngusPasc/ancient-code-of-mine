Hey, [F]Jude, don't make it [C]bad,
Take a [C7sus]sad song and [C7]make it [F]better.
Re[Bb]member to let her into your [F]heart,
Then you can [C7]start to make it [F]better.

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid,
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

     [F7]And anytime you feel the [Bb]pain,
     Hey, Jude, re[Gm7]frain,
     Don't carry the [C7]world upon your [F]shoulders.
     Da da da [F7]da da da [C7]da da da da.

Hey, Jude, don't let me down,
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

     For now you know that it's a fool
     Who plays it cool
     By making his world a little colder.
     Da da da da da da da da da da.

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad,
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
