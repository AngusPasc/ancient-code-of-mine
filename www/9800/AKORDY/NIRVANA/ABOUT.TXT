Subject: CRD: About A Girl

If someone emails me the lyrics, I'll turn this into a really nice TAB
(instead of a spartan CRD).  I don't want to offend anyone, but I can't
imagine this taking someone more than 2 min to strumm out, unless they
don't have the album I guess.  Oh well.  Have no clue to the lyrics,
sorry.   There doesn't seem to be any chorus.

Song: About A Girl
Artist: Nirvana    written by Kurt Cobain
CRD'er: Peter Jay Salzman psalzman@stars.sfsu.edu

This loop is done 4 times, then the E-G thing back and forth 8 times
while he sings (what I think is) Adieu.  The drum queues apply only to
the first time the loop is played.  Guitar solo is done during the 3rd
loop, on the 2nd E-G thing, for the rest of the loop.  I'll transcribe 
the guitar solo on the tab if someone sends me the lyrics, but the solo 
is based on the Em scale for the E-G thing and then goes into power chords, 
following the song chords (ie- C# G# F# C# G# F# E A C).

Before anyone argues with me whether it's E or Em, I'm 90% sure it's
E.  The reason for the minor tonality is a pretty ingenious (or lucky?) 
trick Cobain played with chords.  G happens to be the minor 3rd of E.  
Therefore, even though he plays an E, the tonality of the passsage is 
minor.  I wonder if he was aware of this...

Notes:
All apologies for incorrect lyrics -- this is just how I hear 
them.  No one knows for sure what they are, anyway.

On Bleach, they play this song in standard tuning (EADGBE), 
but on Unplugged they played it a half-step down (Eb Ab Db Gb 
Bb Eb).  

Some say the Em is actually an E or an E5.  Try 'em all and see what
sounds best to you.
