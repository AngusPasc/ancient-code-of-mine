 Gm                               C
 Up in smoke you've lost another lover
         Gm                          C
 As you take a hit of your last cigarette
    Ab        Bb
 Strung out, burnt out, yeah
         Cm                        Bb
 you're down on your luck and you don't give a huh
           Ab                Bb
 'til the best part of you starts to switch
 Ain't that a bitch

   Cm             F       
 Freak out, I'm alone now
    Bb                           Eb
 I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
         Bb               Cm
 'cause love is like the right dress
          Ab
 On the wrong girl
      Eb                           Bb
 You never know what you're gonna find
       Cm                   F
 You think you're high and fine as wine
           Bb                      Eb
 Then you wind up like a dog in a ditch
         Bb              Cm
 'Cause love is like a wrong turn
       Ab         F
 On a cold night     yeah

 Ain't that a bitch


       Cm                     F
 In a daze,in the throes of emotion
          Cm                F
 You see God in the Devil's eyes
           Ab      Bb
 Then you fall so far from grace
      Cm                            Bb
 You wouldn't know a kiss If it was on your face
          Ab                         Bb
 You can tell it to the jury But you ain't got no case


 Freak out, I'm alone now
 I feel just like I'm losin'my mind
 'cause love is like the right dress
 On the wrong girl
 You never know what you're gonna find
 The gal was fine as calamine but not
 enough to scratch a seven year itch
 'cause love is like the last licks outta Hendrix 
 Yeah, ain't that a bitch

 Guitar Solo
 G  C  G  C  G  C

 Then you feel so out of place
 Lickin' up the arsenic
 From the same old lace
 You know the stuff is poison
 But you gotta have a taste, you gotta

 Freak out, I'm alone now
 I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
 'cause love is like the right dress
 On the wrong girl
 You never know what you're gonna find
 You think you're high and fine as wine
 Then you wind up with your face in the ditch
                        Cm      Cm/Bb
 'cause love is like a warm gun
       Ab       Ab/G  F                    Eb  Cdim Ab Eb
 On a cold night       yeah, ain't that a bitch
